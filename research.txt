Introduction
The integration of technology into educational settings is rapidly transforming teaching and learning across various disciplines. In elementary music education, the increasing availability of digital devices presents unique opportunities to engage students and enhance their musical development. This paper explores the potential of game-based digital learning tools as a method to foster student motivation while simultaneously progressing towards established learning objectives. Drawing on principles of student-centered learning, differentiated instruction, and motivation theories, this paper examines how technology can be effectively incorporated into the elementary music classroom. This exploration is grounded in the premise of a project aiming to integrate technology to enhance student motivation and learning outcomes in this specific educational context.
Literature Review: Technology and Motivation in Music Education
One promising avenue for technology integration is gamification, which involves applying game design elements and game principles in non-game contexts (Cavus et al., 2023, p. 212). Gamification has been recognized as a method for attempting to enhance user engagement; it strategically uses behavioral economics, loyalty program design, and game mechanics to cultivate an environment for positive behavior change and enhanced outcomes (Cavus et al., 2023, p. 212). Motivational affordances, such as points, leaderboards, badges, and levels, are key components of gamification designed to stimulate a user's motivational and influence behavior change (Frazier-Roberts & Peoples, 2019, p. 17).
Research into the effects of gamification in education suggests various positive impacts on student engagement and motivation (Weatherly et al., 2024, p. 9). A systematic literature review exploring the effects of gamification in education highlighted its potential to enhance user engagement (Cavus et al., 2023, p. 233). Furthermore, a systematic review of digital game-based learning in music education between 2011 and 2023 analyzed 15 empirical studies, indicating the potential of game-based approaches in this field, where 11 out of 15 yielded positive results and 4 out of 15 yielded mixed results (Weatherly et al, 2024, p. 9). One of the studies that yielded mixed results found that low motivation students showed a greater inclination towards choosing the tablet-based guitar over the acoustic guitar compared to other motivation groups, and this is attributed to their perception of ease and physiological convenience of the digital guitar, potentially positioning tablets as a less intimidating initial musical experience for these learners. (Kang, 2018, p. 286).
Gamification has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance motivation and engagement in educational settings, yet its success is not universal; the effectiveness of gamified learning interventions is intricately tied to the educational context and the unique profiles of individual learners, meaning some students may experience gamified elements such as badges negatively (Freitas-Ribeiro & Peralta, 2019, p. 17). For instance, some students may find badges motivating, interpreting them as symbols of progress and achievement, while others may view them as infantilizing or extrinsically driven, leading to decreased or unchanged intrinsic motivation (Freitas-Ribeiro & Peralta, 2019, p. 25). Consequently, designers of educational technology must approach the development and implementation of gamified systems with a nuanced understanding of their audience, because an ill-conceived or one-size-fits-all approach may not only be ineffective but could actively undermine learning outcomes. According to Self-Determination Theory, human motivation is driven by the fulfillment of three innate psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Ryan & Deci, 2000, p. 1). These psychological needs form a continuum ranging from purely intrinsic to purely extrinsic motivation, challenging the traditional binary view and emphasizing that the same gamified feature may support or hinder learning depending on how it is perceived by the learner (Plass et al., 2009, p. 268). Instead, motivational elements in games should be carefully aligned with learners and educational objectives, as learners may be motivated to engage with the game itself without necessarily engaging meaningfully with the intended content; this creates the potential for what they describe as “gaming the system,” where students complete game tasks without developing deeper understanding (Plass et al., 2009, p. 268). Such findings underscore the importance of matching gamified features—such as rewards, badges, or levels—to the psychological and contextual profiles of the learners. Therefore, thoughtful customization and iterative user feedback should guide the integration of gamified elements, ensuring that they support both motivation and the broader pedagogical goals of the educational program, especially considering that women, for example, report greater perceived social benefits from gamification, while ease of use of gamified systems has been found to decline with age (Koivisto & Hamari, 2014, p. 179).
Game-Based Learning for Student-Centered and Differentiated Instruction
Game-based approaches can make music education more engaging by providing interactive and positive learning experiences (Weatherly et al., 2024, p. 2). Modern technology, including digital games, is often designed to be student-centered, allowing learners to progress at their own pace and engage with content in ways that suit their individual learning styles (Cavus et al., 2023, p. 217). This can foster greater student autonomy as they navigate challenges and make choices within the game environment (Cavus et al., 2023, p. 217).
Technology also holds significant potential for differentiated instruction in elementary music education, because computer-based learning environments can be adapted to offer specialized materials and activities tailored to meet the individual needs of pupils (Király, 2012, p. 15). For example, in the context of melodic dictation, students using computers can hear melodies repeatedly and experiment with notes by playing them back, providing immediate auditory feedback (Király, 2012, p. 89). In a study by Király, one group of pupils had the opportunity to complete melodic dictation tasks on a personal computer before writing with pencil, which differed from the other sample group of pupils who primarily used pencil (Király, 2012, p. 102). The pupils who were given the opportunity to complete it on the computer first  also had a clear printed model to follow, and this group made fewer mistakes compared to the pupils who exclusively used pencil because the pencil only group lacked a computer to check their answers (Király, 2012, p. 102). The use of computers can motivate younger pupils who struggle with writing, as writing with a computer results in neat work,  and also administer immediate feedback that can direct student learning (Király, 2012, p. 104).
Examples of digital learning tools that can be explored in this context include Quaver Music, Chrome Music Lab, Blob Opera, and Incredibox. The interactive nature of these platforms and their potential for both individual and whole-class instruction align with the principles of game-based learning and differentiated instruction.
Assessment and Progress Tracking
Technology can facilitate less formal assessment by embedding progress tracking naturally within game mechanics (Cavus et al., 2018, p. 218). As students engage in game-based music learning activities, their progress can be implicitly monitored through various metrics such as scores, levels achieved, and completion of tasks. For example, in “The Design of a Gamification Algorithm in a Music Practice Application,” the gamification algorithm designed by Frazier-Roberts & Peoples includes mechanisms for earning points by practicing daily and learning new pieces of music (p. 20).  This offers a dynamic view of achievement and progress, moving beyond traditional pencil and paper assessments to provide instant feedback on student learning (Frazier-Roberts & Peoples, 2019, p. 1). The nature of this assessment format allows the teacher to easily pinpoint the struggling students and isolate the areas they are having trouble with which provides opportunity to improve instruction and differentiate to the student population (Cavus et al, 2019, p. 218). 
Addressing Challenges in Technology Integration
Despite the potential benefits, the integration of technology in elementary music education is not without challenges. Issues such as costs for certain educational resources, inconsistent access to devices, and unreliable Wi-Fi connectivity can create barriers to equitable implementation. Furthermore, the systematic review by Weatherly et al. (2024) highlighted concerns regarding the availability and cost of digital game-based learning tools, emphasizing the need for more research on open-access and free resources. Some studies like “​​Motivation and Preference for Acoustic or Tablet-Based Musical Instruments: Comparing Guitars and Gayageums” (Kang, 2018) assume device availability which is not the reality for many teachers. 
This systematic review by Weatherly et al. also draws attention to the issues of transferability of skill to real work contexts and achieving a level of gamification that is appropriate for the classroom without distracting learners from the learning objectives (Weatherly et al., 2024, p. 14).  To mitigate these challenges, practical strategies and backup plans are essential. This might include having alternative non-digital activities available, exploring free or low-cost software options, and advocating for equitable access to technology resources within the school. Even in a technology heavy curriculum it is important that the technology augments the teacher’s instruction instead of replacing it; teacher-pupil interaction is crucial to learning even when integrating computers into instruction   (Király, 2012, Abstract). 
Conclusion
The incorporation of technology, particularly through game-based learning, holds significant promise for enhancing student motivation and improving learning outcomes in elementary music education. By leveraging the engaging nature of digital games and aligning with principles of student-centered and differentiated instruction, educators can create more dynamic and effective learning experiences. However, careful consideration must be given to the design of gamified elements, ensuring they are motivating and appropriate for all learners. Addressing practical challenges related to access and cost is also crucial for equitable technology integration. Future research could focus on evaluating the effectiveness of specific open-access game-based tools and comparing their impact on student learning and motivation against traditional teaching methods. By thoughtfully integrating technology, music educators can unlock new possibilities for fostering a lifelong love of music and supporting the musical development of their students.
